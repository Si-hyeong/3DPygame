# 3D Shape Renderer with Interactive Point Movement

This Python program demonstrates fundamental 3D graphics concepts, including rotation, projection, and user interaction, using **Pygame**. The program is designed to render 3D shapes and provide an interactive simulation for learning **linear algebra** and **multivariable calculus**. 

## Features

- Render 3D shapes defined by vertices and edges (e.g., cube, diamond).
- Real-time rotation using mouse movement.
- Simulate projection from 3D to 2D space.
- Planned feature: Add a moveable point that the user can position to approximate the **center of gravity** of the shape.

## How It Works

1. **Linear Algebra Concepts**:
   - **Rotation**: Apply rotation matrices to adjust the orientation of the shape around the X and Y axes.
   - **Projection**: Convert 3D points to 2D points on the screen using perspective projection.

2. **User Interaction**:
   - Rotate the shape by moving the mouse.
   - Planned feature: Control a moveable point to interactively estimate the center of gravity of the rendered shape.

3. **Mathematical Goal**:
   - Demonstrate the application of multivariable calculus by finding the center of gravity for the shape.
   - Showcase the utilization of linear algebra for 3D graphics.
